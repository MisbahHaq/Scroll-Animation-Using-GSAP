# Scroll Reveal Showcase

An animated scroll experience using [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/), [SplitText](https://greensock.com/splittext/), and [Lenis](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis).  
This project reveals section headings with a **sunrise-style animation**, while **images animate in and out** using dynamic `clip-path` transitions.

## 🧠 How It Works

Each `.work-item` contains:
- A background image (animates via `clip-path`)
- A text container with a **masked heading** that animates upward like a sun rising

The scroll interaction is tied to the vertical position of each section, powered by `ScrollTrigger`.
